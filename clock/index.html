                    <h3>The value of time is a fundamental principle in finance, where a sum of money is worth more now than it will be at a future date due to its earnings potential in the interim.0 The Greek philosopher Theophrastus once said, "Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend." The value of time determines relative prices of goods and services, investments, productivity, economic growth, and measurements of income inequality. Economists in the 1960s began to focus on the value of non-work time, pioneering a deep literature exploring the optimal allocation and value of time.1 The value of one year, one month, one week, and one day can be realized by asking a student who failed a grade, a mother who gave birth to a pre-mature baby, the editor of a weekly newspaper, or a daily wage laborer with kids to feed.2</h3>
